(1)915: create-react-app sim-boids-react

920: filling out some of WorkLog.txt

930: Going to work through some more of this react tutorial I've found (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTeuhbP7wdE). If I am going to incorporate React into this, I need to feel a little more solid with it.

--this now happens in the VSCode terminal, sweet. Luckily the GitBash terminal still works. Gonna iron this issue out eventually

(2)1024: Still working through my tutorial (it's 7 hours, Im at 2:15, so it'll be a bit) --but for some reason the styling is not working (as usual for me) gotta debug a little.

(3)1130: Fixed the styling bug of the tutorial project (had to copy pasta from the repo, this guys lesson didnt exactly match the css involved so....). Still working along with the video. His file structure is slightly different from the epicodus lessons, but I like it. Going to try and replicate it for my Boids.

(4)135: Forgot to check in after coming back from lunch. Still plugging away. This React Movie Data Base app is slick looking. Hopefully I can make this happen in my capstone.

(5)238: I wish this React-movieDb was my project. But i for sure only coded along.

(6)330: Im realizing why this vid is taking so long. I have to pause it every 10 seconds. Im at 3:51, so about 3.5 more hours to go. He is making custom hooks, to handle the api async logic, I dont have to deal with that, but those seem intimidating. I guess we are learning something similar next week. Im gonna go for a little walk to stretch my gams.

(7)410: Tired of this tutorial presently. Going to update the README a little.

455: Sent James and Erik an email hopefully further clarifying my project proposal. Also updated my README with some pertinent information and added my capstone proposal to the file tree. Going to find some boid links for the last hour of the day.

(+7hours 'learning' -- but I realize these don't really 'count')815: So.... I have spent the weekend working through some of a Udemy course on React that I purchased. Because it was a course and not my capstone I neglected to log any hours "worked" I am, this evening, regretting that decision.


[All times moving forward do not include my ~7 hours 'learning'(even though I wish they would be....)]
(9)915: So I've been putting off trying to just cram an implementation of boids that I found into React, because I thought it wouldn't work well...guess what? It doesn't. Turns out there are too many little bits (and errors) to just get it working. So I am going to go in one component at a time till I get mad and scrap it all and just use basic html!

(10)1015: Okay. I got a canvas drawing in p5, but thats about it. I don't see how the functions in the boid implementations that I have in p5Implementations fit together with what I have in CanvasMaker. So I am presently watching some more coding train videos (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alhpH6ECFvQ) in the hopes that I will start to see some patterns. Right now he is doing some wild stuff and I am not getting it. I probably shouldnt have started with a video of porting a fluid simulation paper from 3d to 2d. I will probably watch an 'easier' one next.

(11)1115: More Dan Shiffman videos. I decided to start at the beginning of his series. He's been making these coding train videos for 6 years. I think if i watch them in 2X speed I can get through the whole lot in 3 years...... 

(12)1210: So Ive been at this computer on and of today since around 12. Gonna do 3 more days of this HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHa. I've been Jokerfied. I found a few different in roads to implemeting p5 into React just by googling "how to integrate p5 into react". Im going to try them out tomorrow, and see where I land. But rest now.
