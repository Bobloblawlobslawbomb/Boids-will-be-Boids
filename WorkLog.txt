920: filling out some of WorkLog.txt

930: Going to work through some more of this react tutorial I've found (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTeuhbP7wdE). If I am going to incorporate React into this, I need to feel a little more solid with it.

--this now happens in the VSCode terminal, sweet. Luckily the GitBash terminal still works. Gonna iron this issue out eventually

1024: Still working through my tutorial (it's 7 hours, Im at 2:15, so it'll be a bit) --but for some reason the styling is not working (as usual for me) gotta debug a little.
