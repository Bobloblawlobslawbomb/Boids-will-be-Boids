915: create-react-app sim-boids-react

920: filling out some of WorkLog.txt

930: Going to work through some more of this react tutorial I've found (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTeuhbP7wdE). If I am going to incorporate React into this, I need to feel a little more solid with it.

--this now happens in the VSCode terminal, sweet. Luckily the GitBash terminal still works. Gonna iron this issue out eventually

1024: Still working through my tutorial (it's 7 hours, Im at 2:15, so it'll be a bit) --but for some reason the styling is not working (as usual for me) gotta debug a little.

1130: Fixed the styling bug of the tutorial project (had to copy pasta from the repo, this guys lesson didnt exactly match the css involved so....). Still working along with the video. His file structure is slightly different from the epicodus lessons, but I like it. Going to try and replicate it for my Boids.

135: Forgot to check in after coming back from lunch. Still plugging away. This React Movie Data Base app is slick looking. Hopefully I can make this happen in my capstone.

238: I wish this React-movieDb was my project. But i for sure only coded along.
