920: filling out some of WorkLog.txt

930: Going to work through some more of this react tutorial I've found (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTeuhbP7wdE). If I am going to incorporate React into this, I need to feel a little more solid with it.

--this now happens in the VSCode terminal, sweet. Luckily the GitBash terminal still works. Gonna iron this issue out eventually

(2)1024: Still working through my tutorial (it's 7 hours, Im at 2:15, so it'll be a bit) --but for some reason the styling is not working (as usual for me) gotta debug a little.

(3)1130: Fixed the styling bug of the tutorial project (had to copy pasta from the repo, this guys lesson didnt exactly match the css involved so....). Still working along with the video. His file structure is slightly different from the epicodus lessons, but I like it. Going to try and replicate it for my Boids.

(4)135: Forgot to check in after coming back from lunch. Still plugging away. This React Movie Data Base app is slick looking. Hopefully I can make this happen in my capstone.

(5)238: I wish this React-movieDb was my project. But i for sure only coded along.

(6)330: Im realizing why this vid is taking so long. I have to pause it every 10 seconds. Im at 3:51, so about 3.5 more hours to go. He is making custom hooks, to handle the api async logic, I dont have to deal with that, but those seem intimidating. I guess we are learning something similar next week. Im gonna go for a little walk to stretch my gams.

(7)410: Tired of this tutorial presently. Going to update the README a little.

455: Sent James and Erik an email hopefully further clarifying my project proposal. Also updated my README with some pertinent information and added my capstone proposal to the file tree. Going to find some boid links for the last hour of the day.

(+7hours 'learning' -- but I realize these don't really 'count')815: So.... I have spent the weekend working through some of a Udemy course on React that I purchased. Because it was a course and not my capstone I neglected to log any hours "worked" I am, this evening, regretting that decision.


[All times moving forward do not include my ~7 hours 'learning'(even though I wish they would be....)]

(9)915: So I've been putting off trying to just cram an implementation of boids that I found into React, because I thought it wouldn't work well...guess what? It doesn't. Turns out there are too many little bits (and errors) to just get it working. So I am going to go in one component at a time till I get mad and scrap it all and just use basic html!

(10)1015: Okay. I got a canvas drawing in p5, but thats about it. I don't see how the functions in the boid implementations that I have in p5Implementations fit together with what I have in CanvasMaker. So I am presently watching some more coding train videos (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alhpH6ECFvQ) in the hopes that I will start to see some patterns. Right now he is doing some wild stuff and I am not getting it. I probably shouldnt have started with a video of porting a fluid simulation paper from 3d to 2d. I will probably watch an 'easier' one next.

(11)1115: More Dan Shiffman videos. I decided to start at the beginning of his series. He's been making these coding train videos for 6 years. I think if i watch them in 2X speed I can get through the whole lot in 3 years...... 

(12)1210: So Ive been at this computer on and off today since around 12. I found a few different in roads to implemeting p5 into React just by googling "how to integrate p5 into react". Im going to try them out tomorrow, and see where I land. But rest now.

--------------------------
7/26
--------------------------
(12) 915: Start of day: I've decided that I am spending too much time trying to get React to play nice. I am switching gears today and will focus on making something that just works.

(13) 1015: So my plan is to have a index.html with links to all of the 'explorations' that are in my project. I will click on an <a> tag and it will give us the the view/page for each example. I will grab some examples from (https://p5js.org/examples/) but I want to of course code some of my own, so I will watch some of these coding train videos until I feel good about doing that.

(14) 1115: Frustrating myself trying to get the thing to work. I am using another project to play with the code, but cant get it to display links and then actually link to the examples I am coding. Still watching more p5.js videos from Coding Train. I got a few days and many hours to try though, so I am only slightly worried.

(15) 1215:Broke for lunch around here

(16) 228: Still watching Dan Shiffman. I've made a few [EXAMPLE].js files in my other project. I will add them to this file tree soon. But I still need to make individual index.htmls for them and then link all of them in another (index.)html file, thats how I decided to make my capstone. Super basic, but functional, enough... I got 24 more hours to make it happen.

(17) 340: Still watchin vids. Career services now though. 

(18) 500: I now have a good collection of .js examples. But am still working toward clumping them together with links via html. I feel like I should know this stuff, but am having trouble at the moment. Gonna take a break and revisit soon.

--------------------------

-------------------------


(19) 1010: Woke up a little late today. But started the day with 2 more Shiffman videos and some coffee.

(20) 1210: I know it's been 2 hours. But I only did an hour of learning. So here is me being honest.

(21) 235: OK. I finally got something to work how I want it to. I did the most basic of things, but it still feels pretty good. I feel like I can at least show some stuff off now.

(23) 515: I missed a check in because I'm finally getting things to go -- sort of. I feel like I have something to at least show off now.

------------------------------
7/28
-------------------------------
(24) 915: Started the day with Coffee and a Dan SHiffman coding train video.

(25) 1025: Another 2 Dan Shiffman videos, I should propbably watch ones that are a little more advanced, It's hard to find the "right" ones to watch as they have been doing this for 6 years, and there are a lot to choose from. I also played with my Mitosis simulation further, I really like that one.

(26) 1115: I need to actually do more coding with the project, rather than watching concept videos. I will do that after sending off the cover letters to the potential internships --which I plan to do after lunch.

(27) 1200: Oops, I forgot to commit the last update. Lunch Break.

(28) 400: Retuned from lunch and did my internship applications/New Relic apprenticeship application.

(29) 500: Started styling and 'married' the abomination that I have been working on with the abomination that was my "React-app"

------
ATTN: I added my time spent learning to this WorkLog. If that is uncouth let's talk about it.
------

(36) 500: Hey. So I decided that I ought to count the hours worked in learning the Udemy course in React because the plan was to use that in the finished product. Even though I decided to scrap that portion (for now). I figure in the real world learning the tools still 'counts' towards working and I was doing all that. I still plan to work more than 40 hours with these 7 hours added in. But I wanted to have the hours counted towards my total. I'm happy to discuss this further if you all would like.

(37) (started at 7) 800: Some more styling added. Added a few more examples. Probably will fiddle with some 'implementations' to make them more fun, should I click on them in the presentation.

(38) 900: Tried to incorporate a really sweet (and more complex) version of boids, but it needed more than html to giddy up.

(39) 1000: Just new style goofin' - I wanted to do a moving pure css background and I found a way to do so.
